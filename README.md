## Description of Notebook Contents

This notebook contains the following sections:

1. Data Generation: A function to generate sample data for demonstration purposes.
2. Task Calculation: A function to calculate rewards based on age and food preferences.
3. Methods:
   - Level 1: Using loops for calculations.
   - Level 2: Utilizing the apply function.
   - Level 3: Vectorization for optimized performance.

## Usage

To use this notebook, follow these steps:
1. Run the cells in order to generate sample data and define necessary functions.
2. Execute each method cell to calculate rewards using different approaches.
3. Analyze the results and performance differences among the methods.

## Results

The notebook compares the execution time of different methods for calculating rewards and demonstrates significant performance improvements through vectorization.

## Conclusion

Vectorization proves to be the most efficient method for calculating rewards in this scenario, significantly reducing computation time compared to loop-based and apply function approaches.
